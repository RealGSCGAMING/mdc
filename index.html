        <h1>THIS WEBSITE IS A WAGER</h1>
        <p>There is a million dollars at the end of this form. That is the only instruction that matters.</p>
        <p>The internet has shown us that friction implies legitimacy. If something asks enough of you, it must be real.
            If it wastes enough time, it's important.</p>
        <p>By continuing, you make a wager. Your time is spent on a possibility.</p>
        <p>You accept a role. You become the performer. There is no audience except for the system and the part of you
            that keeps going.<br><small style="font-size: 10px;">The secret word can be found <a
                    href="secretword.png">here</a></small>. </p>
        <p>Money is powerful. So powerful it has you reading this sentence. So powerful it stops you from asking the
            wrong question.</p>
        <p>The prize is at the end.</p>
